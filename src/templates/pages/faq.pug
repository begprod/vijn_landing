								h3 How do I start scanning?
								p Scanning with PT BBS is fast and easy. Just enter the address of your site—on the internet or a local network—and configure your scanning method:
								.readmore__inner
									.readmore__hidden-text.js-read-more-hidden-text
										.readmore__hidden-text-inner
											ul
												li Without confirmation of site ownership, you can scan via an agent. An agent is a small program that can be run without local installation—just open a secure executable file and you can start scanning. This is a convenient method when you cannot or do not want to make alterations to your site's root directory, or when your site is located behind a NAT (in a local network). Note that this method does not allow for anonymous scanning. All requests from the agent are tunneled from our service to the site being scanned via the computer of the user who initiated the scanning. This means that the computer (IP address) where the requests originated will be visible on the site side.
												li With confirmation of site ownership. For this method, a special HTML file must be placed in the root directory of the site that you want to scan. Our system will "see" the file and allow scanning to be initiated.

								h3 What is an agent and what is it used for? Why might several agents be needed?
								p installation or any special privileges. Agents are needed to scan sites in local networks (behind NATs) and in cases when site ownership cannot be confirmed using a certificate. This occurs, for instance, when an audit is performed by external experts who do not have access to site servers. The agent creates a tunnel to send requests from the server conducting the scan to the site that is being scanned.

										.readmore__hidden-text-inner
											p When scanning via an agent, a corresponding setting must be toggled when initially configuring the scan. The agent must then be launched and activated with a code generated by our service before scanning begins. 
											p It is possible to use multiple agents with a single account. This feature is needed if you plan to scan different sites from different locations, such as from your workplace and home computer, on a local network, or remotely. By default, we try to conduct scans using the most recently downloaded agent. However, if you would like to configure scans of specific sites with specific agents, you can do so in the site's settings.

								h3 How can I configure a scan for an area of a site that is only login and password accessible (with required authentication)?
								p Our service supports two types of scanning for authentication-protected sites: HTTP Basic and HTML Form. These can be enabled while selecting scanning parameters for a given site. To do so, mark the "Authentication" checkbox and select the desired scan type:
								.readmore__inner
									.readmore__hidden-text.js-read-more-hidden-text
										.readmore__hidden-text-inner
											ul
												li HTTP Basic authentication will only require the username and password of the user under whose name scanning has been authorized on the site.
												li HTML Form authentication requires the URL of the authorization form and a verification string in addition to the username and password. A verification string is any fragment of text from a page with authorization-controlled access. This text fragment is needed for the scanner to verify successful authorization.

								h3 Can I scan web applications that are located behind a NAT (on a local network)?
								p Yes. This can be done using a type of secure executable file called an agent. The agent must be launched and activated on the computer you want to start scanning from.
							.readmore
								h3 How often should sites be scanned?
								p We recommend that sites be scanned no less frequently than twice a month, as well as after installing any updates. Even if an update does not directly alter your site, it can change the site environment or its CMS version, possibly opening new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. We regularly update our algorithms and knowledge base to help you quickly detect and eliminate vulnerabilities, thereby greatly increasing the security of your site and its users.
								p Thanks to the scan history, information about your past tests is saved and does not disappear. You can view your past scan results at any time and get a detailed, diachronic view of your site's security.
							.readmore
								h3 Could the requests sent from your scanner disrupt my site?
								p The chance of problems arising from scanning is extremely low. We specially selected requests with the aim of eliminating any possibility of interference with sites being scanned. Moreover, our scanner analyses the links on the site it is scanning, identifies "dangerous" links (for example, links related to page deletion) and avoids them entirely.
								p Despite the fact that we designed our scanner for maximal security, we strongly recommend that sites be scanned in a test environment. In addition, be sure to make periodic backups (even if you don't plan on scanning your site).
							.readmore
								h3 How long does it take to scan a site?
								p The time it takes to scan a site depends on the site's size and complexity, as well as on connection quality and the location of the servers that the site runs on. We have found that scans can take anywhere from a few minutes, for simple sites, up to 10 or more hours for the most complex sites.
							.readmore.js-read-more
								h3 How will I know when the scan has finished?
								p While scanning, our service displays an indicator that tracks scan progress as a percentage. When a scan is complete, its status will change in the scan list as well as under "Notifications." In subsequent versions of the product, we plan to add an email notification feature. If a scan has run for a very long time without completing, or if it freezes or is interrupted, be sure to check the following:
								.readmore__inner
									.readmore__hidden-text.js-read-more-hidden-text
										.readmore__hidden-text-inner
											ul
												li Internet connection. The scan could encounter problems if your connection is interrupted, or if the data center where your site is located experiences connection issues.
												li Is the agent program running? If the scan is being run through an agent program, be sure that it is running.
												li Is the site being scanned accessible? Be sure that your site is not blocking server requests and that it opens in a browser. If your site is virtually hosted, contact your hosting provider. It is possible that requests from PT BBS are being blocked due to their quantity and frequency. In subsequent versions of the service, we intend to make the frequency of sent requests configurable.
											p Every 30 seconds the agent program updates the scan status in the console and the scan indicator on the service page.
											p We value your time and don't want hiccups in our service to slow down your scan. That's why we included a service function monitoring system, which sends us real-time information about problems that arise while you are scanning. If we are responsible for a scan interruption, we will immediately resolve the problem and keep you informed.

								h3 If PT BlackBox Scanner detects multiple vulnerabilities with varying risk levels, which vulnerabilities should I address, and how?
								p Scan results are communicated in a report which includes a number of useful parameters for each detected vulnerability. These include the type of vulnerability, the severity of the threat it poses, its attack vector, and the "request—response" pairing responsible for its detection.
								p You can find a wealth of information on vulnerabilities and attacks in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/" target="_blank">OWASP knowledge base</a>.
							.readmore
								h3 What does "threat level" mean? Is it OK to leave low-risk vulnerabilities unaddressed?
								p "Threat level" indicates how dangerous a detected vulnerability really is. The higher the threat level, the more damage can be inflicted by an attacker who exploits the vulnerability. Threat level is a helpful tool when determining triage for addressing vulnerabilities. Red (high-level) vulnerabilities should be addressed first, then yellow (medium-level) vulnerabilities, then any others.
								p It is not good security practice to ignore low-level vulnerabilities, since some attacks can be carried out by exploiting several vulnerabilities, even if those vulnerabilities seem innocuous when viewed individually. Attackers generally cannot break into a system by exploiting only low-level vulnerabilities. However, such vulnerabilities can make it much easier for attackers to collect information about a site, which they can then use in later attacks.
							.readmore
								h3 How can I verify that vulnerabilities have been properly addressed?
								p You must perform a second scan of your site to confirm that vulnerabilities have been properly fixed. For added convenience, our service is designed to mark vulnerabilities that have been eliminated as "Fixed." If yet another scan is performed and the vulnerability is found to have reoccurred, the "Fixed" marker will disappear.
							.readmore
								h3 Can multiple sites be scanned simultaneously?
								p The current version of PT BBS does not allow simultaneous scans. However, subscribers are able to scan an unlimited number of sites and can perform scans an unlimited number of times.
								p We plan to include simultaneous site scanning in future versions of the product.
							.readmore
								h3 Can I scan sites that I do not own?
								p No, scanning sites that you do not own is forbidden, as such an action would violate Russian law and the terms of the PT BlackBox Scanner end-user license agreement.
								p Articles 272 and 273 of the Criminal code of the Russian Federation establish liability for unauthorized access and copying of computer information.
								p Section 6 of the PT BlackBox Scanner end-user license agreement establishes liability for misuse of PT BlackBox Scanner. You as the user are held responsible for any losses, functionality issues, or damage caused to a third-party website with which you utilized PT BlackBox Scanner.

								h3 How can I use PT BBS without registering?
								p You can use a trial version of PT BBS without registration. Simply start configuring your scan from our main webpage. Just enter your site URL in the field and press <Scan Now>, and you'll be up and running! This is what we refer to as a "demonstration scan."
								.readmore__inner
									.readmore__hidden-text.js-read-more-hidden-text
										.readmore__hidden-text-inner
											p However, demonstration scans are subject to several limitations:
											ul
												li Period of data storage. If you don't visit the site for a week, your scan data will disappear.
												li Scan limit. You can only complete one demonstration scan. This is a necessary restriction since there is no account associated with the scan. If you want to save your scan data, you must register.
												li Sites can only be scanned with verification via Agent. This restriction has the same justification as other restrictions. Since demonstration scans are temporary and HTML verification is intended for site scans without user input, verification loss is a real possibility. To avoid this, you must register for the service.
												li Sites that require authentication cannot be scanned. Our demonstration scans are designed with an eye towards maximizing simplicity. Authentication configuration is a process that requires the storage of personal user data, and to store this data, registration is necessary.
											p Trying out a demonstration scan is simple. Just enter your site's address, download the agent program, and launch it. Within a few minutes you will start to see vulnerabilities as they are detected.
											p If you want to save the results of a demonstration scan, you can register at any time. All scans and configuration settings will be transferred to your new account.
