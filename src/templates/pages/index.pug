									p Vijn scans sites by sending requests and analyzing the responses. If a vulnerability is suspected, it sends requests to confirm this.
									p Scanning methods include signature analysis (determining the version of software in use and using this information to probe for known vulnerabilities) plus a number of heuristics.
									p Thanks to this, we can scan popular platforms, including WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, as well as self-written sites (such as corporate portals or custom-developed online stores).
